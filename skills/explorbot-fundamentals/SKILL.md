# Explorbot Fundamentals

Explorbot is an autonomous AI web-testing CLI. It drives its own browser through cycles of research → plan → test, and an agent drives it like `git` or `npm`.

**Answer command and flag questions from the installed CLI, never from memory.**

```bash
npx explorbot --help                  # commands, and the EXPLORBOT_* variables
npx explorbot <command> --help        # flags for one command
```

## Running it with nothing installed

Explorbot needs no project install: `npx` plus a provider is enough, and nothing is written into the working directory. Reach for this when the user wants to try Explorbot, or is pointing it at an app that has no repo here.

```bash
npx explorbot init --global --provider <name>          # once per machine, key in ~/.explorbot/.env
npx explorbot explore https://app.example.com/login --max-tests 3
```

Details, including the per-command `EXPLORBOT_*` form for CI: [references/no-install.md](references/no-install.md).

Installing into the project instead — config, knowledge, and generated tests in the repo — is [[explorbot-setup]].

## Docs

`node_modules/explorbot/docs/` after a local install, the repo's `docs/` when working inside Explorbot itself, otherwise `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/testomatio/explorbot/main/docs/<path>`. `docs/index.json` lists every page with a description — read it to pick the page, then open that page.

## Where results land

Explorbot writes into the project directory when the run used a project `explorbot.config.js`, and into `~/.explorbot/sites/<host>/` otherwise. Under that root:

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `output/reports/` | session report: coverage, defects, execution issues |
| `output/plans/` | the plan generated or executed |
| `output/states/` | per-state HTML, ARIA snapshots, screenshots |
| `output/research/` | UI maps from the Researcher |
| `output/tests/` | generated Playwright / CodeceptJS files |
| `output/explorbot.log` | run log — start here on a failure |
| `knowledge/`, `experience/` | what you taught it, and what it learned |

**Exit codes are not pass/fail.** `explore` and `test` exit `0` whenever the session completes; a failing scenario is a result, not a crash. Read the report. `navigate` is the exception — `1` means unreachable, which makes it a pre-flight check.

## Naming the site

Without a project config there is no configured URL, so each command names its own site: a URL argument, or a host already registered (`npx explorbot explore app.example.com/dashboard`, listed by `npx explorbot sites`). Commands that take no URL argument — `test`, `learn`, `knows`, `experience`, `compact` — read `EXPLORBOT_URL`.

## Cheap before expensive

- `npx explorbot context <url>` — headings, matched knowledge, interactive elements. No AI calls.
- `npx explorbot shell <url> '<codecept command>'` — run one command and exit.
- `npx explorbot knows <url>` — what knowledge matches a page.
- `npx explorbot navigate <url> --session` — reachability, and it saves the session.

## Rules

- `explorbot start` is an interactive TUI — an agent cannot operate it. Ask the user to run it. Everything else runs headless and exits.
- If `--help` does not show a command or flag, it does not exist.
- Explorbot needs CRUD; a landing page, blog, or CMS is out of scope.

## Related skills

- [[explorbot-setup]] — install into a project: config, provider, login knowledge, verified navigation.
- [[explorbot-plan]] — hand-author a test plan and run it with `explorbot test`.
